      <p>The Palate Deck is new type of beer education, currently under development. It&#8217;s a set of 108 playing cards that can casually teach anyone how to understand and evaluate beer like a pro using common culinary terms they&#8217;re already familiar with from other food and drink.</p>

    <h2 class="header-sub">Why The Palate Deck?</h2>

    <p>There have never been more people talking about what they're tasting when sampling great beer. But existing beer education caters to more engaged consumers, leaving those who won't bother picking up a book or taking a class with limited vocabulary to describe their beer.</p>

    </a>

    <p>What about a more casual, accessible beer education that can be picked up by anyone in a tasting room or at home? One that seeds the conversation with familiar aromas and flavors to encourage lively discussion. One that can help a beer drinker of any experience quickly level up their tasting and evaluation ability. One that's engaging and fun.</p>
    <p>That's the Palate Deck.</p>

      <h2 class="header-primary">How it Works</h2>

      <p>The Palate Deck is a series of card decks that offer progressive gameplay and beer evaluation tools. At it's most basic, a player starts with culinary terms they're already familiar with and uses those to match flavors and sensations they're experiencing in a beer. At higher levels, more evaluation options and expanded gameplay are offered to get to the heart of a beer's profile.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">Using the Palate Deck</h3>
      <p>In its most basic form, the Palate Deck encourages conversation between players by having them collaboratively design a visual profile of a beer by matching Tasting Cards against each of the Evaluation criteria.</p>

      <figure class="preview-example">
        <a href="/images/illustration-level1.png" class="image-zoom">
          <img src="/images/illustration-level1.png" alt="The Palate Deck Tutorial">
        </a>
        <figcaption><strong>Tutorial mode</strong> &#8212; their first time using the Palate Deck, players will be asked to create a very simple visual layout to represent a beer's basic character. The reduced card set and evaluation tools are designed to encourage those unfamiliar with beer evaluation to give it a try.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <p>In advanced rounds, players are also asked to comment on intensity of each sensation to build a more nuanced visual grid that represents the beer they're sampling.</p>

          <img src="/images/illustration-level2.png" alt="Advanced Usage">
        </a>
        <figcaption><strong>Advanced mode</strong> &#8212; once familiar with basic beer evaluation, players can add more complexity by collaboratively designing a visual grid to represent the beer's character.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <p>Conversation is key when using the Palate Deck. The design of the cards purposely seeds the discussion with similar tastes and experiences to add vocabulary to the conversation when players might not otherwise have the words. If it sparks healthy debate over nuances of a beer, it has succeeded; the purpose isn't to be correct, it's to find consensus. Tasting is subjective, after all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">The Card Design</h3>

      <p>Each tasting card contains one primary word or phrase that drives gameplay. But in addition, it offers similar words that offer clarifying context, a technical description about why that flavor or sensation may be present in a beer, and basic information on categorization and frequency. <a href="/docs/tasting-cards.pdf">More detail</a> is available if you're curious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">First Edition</h3>

      <p>The first edition will include two decks of cards, Level I and Level II, with all the cards necessary for a few different styles of basic to intermediate gameplay and evaluation.</p>

      <ul class="card-list">

          </a>
          <h4 class="header-inline">Evaluation Cards</h4>
          <p>The four primary Evaluation cards are the basic traits used to organize the other cards in most game modes, and are the common aspects used in beer evaluation: Appearance, Aroma, Taste, and Mouthfeel</p>

          <h4 class="header-inline">Tasting Family Cards</h4>
          <p>These are common and fundamental flavors and aromas people should already be familiar with from cuisine and other drinks.</p>

          <p>Tasting Words that relate to the Family Cards, but cover more specific flavors and aromas.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </div>



    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-sub">Future Editions</h3>

      <p><strong>Second Edition</strong> &#8212; The second edition will offer more nuanced and specific tasting options and includes Level III and Level IV decks. The Taste Evaluation card from the first edition will be broken into four distinct phases common in the wine world to allow for more nuanced beer evaluation: Initial, Mid-Palate, Finish, and Aftertaste. Extra beer color cards will allow nuanced color evaluation, including tints attained from various additives, and tasting cards become far more specific, referring to character found in very few beers.</p>

      <p><strong>Sensory Edition</strong> &#8212; This edition reverses the card design of lower levels and replaces earlier cards by putting chemical compounds up front, and matches them to flavours. Paper becomes Trans 2 Nonenal, Pineapple becomes Ethyl Butyrate, Floral becomes Geraniol, and so on. This edition is for people who are studying beer in a more professional capacity.</p>

      <p><strong>Screwball Edition</strong> &#8212; provides a vocabulary for those strange, unexpected flavors and aromas that don't occur naturally in a beer. Everyone has experienced this at some point: a strange character present in a beer that is undefinable, until someone comes up with an evocative flavor association that somehow fits that character perfectly. Some examples: Bicycle Tire, Bug Spray, Incense, Olive Oil, etc.</p>
